## Questions
1. The second admin api is returning List of Discount codes,
  - Why do we need to return list of discount codes?
  - Can the merchant use multiple discount codes on a single order (i.e., will applying 2 discount codes give 20% discount)?
  - If multiple discount is possible then is there a criteria on maximum discount because 11 discount codes i.e. 110% discount will cause cash back?

2. Can we assume the following two API's are already available? Can this be stubbed?
  -The store also has two admin API's:
    Generate a discount code if the condition above is satisfied.
    Lists count of items purchased, total purchase amount, list of discount codes and total discount amount.
